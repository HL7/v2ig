Take the odd digit positions, counting from the right, i.e., 531, multiply this number by 2 to get 1062. Take the even digit positions, starting from the right (i.e., 42), prepend these to the 1062 to get 421062. Add all of these six digits together to get 15. Subtract this number from the next highest multiple of 10, i.e., 20 - 15 to get 5. The Mod10 check digit is 5. The Mod10 check digit for 401 is 0; for 9999, it’s 4; for 99999999, it’s 8.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm for calculating a Mod11 check digit is as follows:\n\n\n\n.*Terms*\n\n[width=\"100%\",cols=\"8%,5%,87%\",]\n\n|===\n\n|d |= |digit of number starting from units digit, followed by 10’s position, followed by 100’s position, etc.\n\n|w |= |weight of digit position starting with the units position, followed by 10’s position, followed by 100’s position etc. Values for w = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. (repeats for each group of 6 digits)\n\n|c |= |check digit\n\n|===\n\n\n\n.*Calculation*\n\n[width=\"100%\",cols=\"18%,5%,77%\",]\n\n|===\n\n|(Step 1) m |= a|\n\nsum of (d * w) for positions 1, 2, etc. starting with units digit\n\n\n\nfor d = digit value starting with units position to highest order\n\n\n\nfor w = weight value from 2 to 7 for every six positions starting with units digit\n\n\n\n|(Step 2) c1 |= |m mod 11\n\n|(Step 3) if c1 |= |0 then reset c1 = 1\n\n|(Step 4) |= |(11 - c1) mod 10\n\n|===\n\n\n\nExample:\n*Example:*\n\n\n\nIf the number is 1234567, then the mod 11 check digit = 4\n\n\n\nThe calculations are:\n\n\n\nM = (7*2)+(6*3)+(5*4)+(4*5)+(3*6)+(2*7)+(1*2)\n\n\n\n{empty}= 14 + 18 + 20 + 20 + 18 + 14 + 2\n\n\n\n{empty}= 106\n\n\n\nc1 = 106 mod 11\n\n\n\n{empty}= 7\n\n\n\nc = (11-c1) mod 10\n\n\n\n{empty}= 4 mod 10\n\n\n\n{empty}= 4\n\n\n\nOther variants of these check digit algorithms exist and may be used by local bilateral site agreement.\n\n\n\n*NOTE:* The check digit and code identifying check digit scheme are null if ID is alphanumeric.\n",

It is *not* recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1.
