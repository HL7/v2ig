This second component will be used to clarify the first component in cases where the actual times vary within an institution. If the time of the order spans more than a single day, this new component is only practical if the same times of administration occur for each day of the order. If the actual start time of the order (as given by the fourth component of the quantity/timing field) is after the first explicit time, the first administration is taken to be the first explicit time after the start time. In the case where the patient moves to a location having a different set of explicit times, the existing order may be updated with a new quantity/timing field showing the changed explicit times.\n\n\n\nExample:\n2nd component of quantity/timing field:\n\n\n\n|QID^0230,0830,1430,2030|\n",
