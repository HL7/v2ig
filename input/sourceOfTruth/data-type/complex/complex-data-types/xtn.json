  "description": "Example 1: A Work fax number\n\n^WPN^FX^^^734^6777777\n\nExample 2: Telephone number with extension\n\n^WPN^PH^^^734^6777777^1\n\nExample 2: Telephone number with internal code. In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports a full external telephone number (area code and telephone number). It also supports internal dialing standards that assign a code to each facility and an extension to each telephone (which happens to be the last 4 digits of the external telephone number, by convention).\n\nSo, if the Los Angeles facility were assigned code 333, and if the \"outside\" telephone number at the LA office is (626) 555-1234, the components would be:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<th>Component </th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>area/city code </td>\n<td>626</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>phone number </td>\n<td>555-1234</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>extension </td>\n<td>1234</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>extension prefix </td>\n<td>333</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThe field would be transmitted as follows:\n\n^WPN^PH^^^626^5551234^1234^333\n\nExample 3: speed dial. In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports speed dialing numbers. For example, suppose that a corporation has a contract with a travel agency, whose external number is 1-610-555-1234. Since it is so frequently dialed, the company assigns a speed code: #6098. The components would be:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<th>Component </th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Area/city code </td>\n<td>610</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Phone number </td>\n<td>555-1234</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Speed Dial </td>\n<td>#6098</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThe field would be transmitted as follows:\n\n^WPN^PH^^^610^5551234^^^#6098\n\nExample 4: home e-mail address. In this example, assume that a person has a primary home e-mail address such as someone@somewhere.com. The components would be:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<th>Component </th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Telecommunication Use Code </td>\n<td>PRN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Telecommunication Equipment Type </td>\n<td>Internet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Communication Address </td>\n<td>someone@somewhere.com</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThe field would be transmitted as follows:\n\n^PRN^Internet^someone@somewhere.com\n\nExample 5: work e-mail address. In this example, assume that a person has a work e-mail address such as someone@somewhere.com. The components would be:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<th>Component </th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Telecommunication Use Code </td>\n<td>WPN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Telecommunication Equipment Type </td>\n<td>Internet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Communication Address </td>\n<td>someone@somewhere.com</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThe field would be transmitted as follows:\n\n^WPN^Internet^someone@somewhere.com"
