Derivation rules that are represented in Arden Syntax should begin and end with an Arden slot delimiter (;;). Within this syntax, variables should be identified by _OM1-2 - Producer's Service/Test/Observation ID_. We recommend the use of the Arden Syntax because it permits the unambiguous specification of most such derived values and is a published standard for medical logic modules.",
