The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (section 2.A.36, \"HD – Hierarchic designator\"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.\n\nSee _ORC-2-placer order number_ (section *Error! Reference source not found.*) for information on when this field must be valued.\n\nA given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).\n\nThe conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in _ORC-2_ and _OBR-2_ are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in _ORC-3_ and _OBR-3_ are logically the same thing: the filler id.\n\nFrom that perspective, each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a \"Send Number\" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.\n\nIf both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.\n\nIt is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated.\n\nThese rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).",

The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required.

For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.\n\nSimilarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with _ORC-1-order control_ equal to \"CA\" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.",

The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports, or the specific result for which this order or observation is a reflex. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization. In the case of a reflex order, if it is necessary to point to the specific result value for which it is in response, OBR-26 enables pointing to that specific OBX segment.",

It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.\n\nThis field is present only when the parent result is identified by _OBR-29-_ Result Observation Identifier or OBR-54, Parent Order__,__ and the parent spawns child orders or results for each of many results. (See Chapter 7 for more details about this linkage.)\n\nA second mode of conveying this information is to use a standard observation result segment (OBX). If more than one organism is present, _OBX-4-observation sub-ID_ is used to distinguish them. In this case, the first OBX with subID N will contain a value identifying the Nth microorganism, and each additional OBX with subID N will contain susceptibility values for a given antimicrobial test on this organism.",
