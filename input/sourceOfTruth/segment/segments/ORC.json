        "comment": "This field may be considered the \"trigger event\" identifier for orders. The codes fall roughly into the following three categories:\n\n{empty}a) event request – Codes like \"NW\" (new order) and \"CA\" (cancel order request) are used to initiate an event .\n\n{empty}b) event acknowledgment – Codes like \"OK\" (order accepted) and \"CR\" (canceled as requested) are used to reply to the event request .\n\n{empty}c) event notification – Codes like \"OC\" (order canceled) and \"OD\" (order discontinued) are used to notify other applications that an event has occurred. No application reply is necessary.\n\nEvent request codes are intended to initiate an event. Event acknowledgment codes are intended to reply to an application that requested an event. Event notification codes are intended to notify another application that, e.g., the filler has performed some action on an order that the other application, e.g., the placer, needs to know.\n\nFillers, placers, and other applications can use event requests, event acknowledgments, and event – notification-type trigger events interchangeably. However, certain order control codes can originate only from the filler (e.g., CR) and others can only originate from the placer (e.g., CA).\n\nRefer file:///E:\\V2\\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70119[HL7 Table 0119 – Order Control Codes] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables__.__",

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, \"HD – Hierarchic designator\"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.\n\nThere are three situations in which the true placer is somewhat arbitrary (and thus not unique):\n\n{empty}a) in ORC-1-order control value of RO, following an RU replacement;\n\n{empty}b) in ORC-1-order control value of CH (child orders); and\n\n{empty}c) in ORC-1-order control value of SN (send number).\n\nSee the Table Notes under ORC-1-order control for the details of how the ORC-2-placer order number is assigned in these cases.\n\nThe application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).\n\nThe conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.\n\nFrom that perspective each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a \"Send Number\" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.\n\nIf both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). Note that if both ORC-2 and OBR-2 are valued then they must be valued the same; as well, if both ORC-3 and OBR-3 are valued, then they must be valued the same. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.\n\nIt is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated.\n\nThese rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).",

For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.\n\nSimilarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to \"CA\" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.",

ORC-15 by taking precedence over TQ1 and ORC-9, would tell the Filler to continue to perform the order event until June 7, and cancel all remaining events (treatment, procedures etc..) after that time. If the order identified in the ORC has children, the children which have not started should be canceled; if there is a child in process, it should be discontinued; if a child has progressed beyond the point where it can be discontinued, its status is unaffected.",
