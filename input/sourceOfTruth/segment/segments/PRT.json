For example, for FDA UDIs the root shall be 2.16.840.1.113883.3.3719, and the extension shall be the Human Readable Form appropriate for the style of content. When captured as a simple string, the string shall be the Human Readable Form appropriate for the style of content. The content style can be determined from the leading characters of the content:\n\nUDIs beginning with:\n\n‘(‘ are in the GS1 Human Readable style;\n\n‘0-9’ are a GS1 DI (containing only the DI value, no PI or GS1 AI);\n\n‘+‘ are in the HIBCC Human Readable style;\n\n‘=‘ or ‘&’ are in the ICCBBA Human Readable style.\n\nNote: If “&” is used in the UDI while one of the delimiters in MSH.2 includes “&” as well, it must be properly escaped per Chapter 2.7.\n\nThe exchange of UDI sub-elements in PRT-16 through PRT-21 is not required when the full UDI string is provided in PRT-10. Whether to include some or all these fields as well when PRT-10 is present with a UDI that the rules are subject to specific implementation guides that will have to consider the patient safety implications of potentially conflicting data.\n\nWhen a UDI is provided and sub-elements are also provided, then for those sub-elements that are valued, the content must match the content encoded in the UDI if it is encoded within the UDI.\n\nWhen communicating a UDI, the UDI may either be uniquely identifying an instance of a device, or a type of device. This can be asserted based on the inclusion or absence of a serial number in the Product Identifier section of the UDI. When the serial number is present, PRT-10 must be used, while if it is absent, PRT-22 must be used.\n\n*Caution:* The UDI may contain personally identifying information in the form of the device *serial number* which may be used to link to other information on a patient. Security and privacy consideration should be addressed, particularly when sending a UDI with a serial number, as that may inadvertently be able to identify a patient. Note: In the US realm that would be addressed by HIPAA.\n\nNote: PRT-10 Device is a repeating field. Additional device identifiers, such as an IEEE EUI-64 may also be contained in this field.",
