The receiving application is therefore unable to submit unsolicited messages. To mitigate this, a polling approach is used where the receiving application requests any queued messages when it is connected. To avoid the network overhead of continuous polling, the sending application needs a way to indicate that there are queued messages awaiting retrieval. It is also useful to provide an indication of the importance of those messages to indicate how quickly they must be retrieved.\n\nRefer to file:///E:\\V2\\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70520[_HL7 Table 0520 - Message Waiting Priority_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.\n\nSee MSA-7 above for Use Case.",
