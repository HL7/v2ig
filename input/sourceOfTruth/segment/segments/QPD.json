Parameter fields may also contain the sort control (SRT) field or the segment group (ID) field defined in Sections _5.5.6.6_, \"_RCP-6 Sort-by Field (SRT)_ 01624,\" and _5.5.6.7_, \"_RCP-7 Segment Group Inclusion (ID)_ 01594,\" below.\n\nParameter fields in the QPD segment appear in the same order as in the Query Profile.",
