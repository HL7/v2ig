* 1 1..0 CWE "CTD-1" "This field contains the contact role that defines the relationship of the person described in this segment to the patient being referred. When a referral is inter-enterprise in nature, there are some important relationships that must be identified. For example, it may be necessary to identify the contact representative at the clinic that sent the referral. file:///E:\\V2\\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70131[_User-defined Table 0131 - Contact Role_] (in Chapter 3, \"Patient Administration\")is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this field."

For example, if this contact represents the office manager of the referred-to physician, then the contact location should identify the clinic of the physician or provider to whom this referral has been sent. An application and facility identifier carried in the facility field specifies the identification of the contact's location. The application identifier and the facility identifier would be used in the same manner as their corresponding fields in the MSH segment (_MSH-3-Sending application, MSH-5-Receiving application, MSH-4-Sending facility, MSH-6-Receiving facility_). That is, the facility field will contain an application identifier and facility identifier which describe the location of this contact. However, it should be noted that they may describe a different location because the contact location being referenced in this field _may not be_ the location from which the message originated, which is being described by the MSH."
