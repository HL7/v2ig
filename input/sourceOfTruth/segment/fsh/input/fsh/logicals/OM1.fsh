Indianapolis: Regenstrief Institute and LOINC Committee, 1995.] They are derived from the approach described in 1995 edition of the IUPAC Silver Book.footnote:[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry/International Federation of Clinical Chemistry. The Silver Book: Compendium of terminology and nomenclature of properties in clinical laboratory sciences. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publishers, 1995.] These distinctions are used in IUPAC and LOINC standard codes.

The table contains a number of \"families,\" those related to simple counts (number, number concentration, etc.), to mass (mass, mass concentration, etc.), to enzyme activity (catalytic content, catalytic concentration, etc.), and molar or equivalents (substance content, substance concentration).\n\nBy this classification, a glucose (in the US) would be classed as a mass concentration. A sodium would be classed as a substance concentration. Within the family, a total amount should be described as the unadorned variant; e.g., the property of measure for a patient's weight would be mass, not mass content. Most chemical measures produce concentrations, as exemplified by sodium and glucose. However, a 24-hour urine protein is not a mass concentration, but a mass rate (mass per unit time).
