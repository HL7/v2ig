= Data Types

In a data type definition, square brackets, "[" and "]", are used to specify optional parts of a string. For instance, the format of a date field is “YYYY[MM[DD]]” which denotes that the field may contain four, six, or eight characters respectively. The characters may further constrain the possible contents of the string – this will be documented at the point of use.
