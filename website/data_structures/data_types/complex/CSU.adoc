*Attention: _Retained for backward compatibility only in version 2.7._* This is used only in the CD Channel Definition data type, which has been retained for backward compatibility only in version 2.7.

As of v2.7 a third tuple, formerly known as triplet, has been added to the CSU data type. Additionally, 3 new components were added to each tuple such that each tuple now has a total of 7 components. The Original Text component applies to the CSU as a whole.

[datatype-definition]
This data type defines the channel sensitivity (gain) and the units in which it is measured in a waveform result.

[NOTE]
Replaces the CM data type used in 7.14.1.5 OBX-5.3 where OBX-5 Observation value (*) is data type CD as of v 2.5.
