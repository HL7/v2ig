# (CCP) Data Type - channel calibration parameters

**Attention: Retained for backward compatibility only in version 2.7.** This is used only in the CD Channel Definition data type, which has been retained for backward compatibility only in v2.7.

This data type identifies the corrections to channel sensitivity, the baseline, and the channel time skew when transmitting waveform results.

Replaces the CM data type used in 7.14.1.5 OBX-5.3 where OBX-5 Observation value (*) is data type CD as of v 2.5.
