== XTN.18 - Preference Order (NM)

[datatype-definition]
For an entity having multiple telecommunication addresses, indicates which is the "most preferred" (lowest number) to "least preferred" (highest number).

If the preference order is unique across all usages for a given type, then it indicates the preference across all usages, (e.g. first try my home number, then my business number). If the preference order is unique across all usages and types, then it indicates the preference across all types of telecommunication addresses. (E.g., first try my phone; if that doesn't work, use my pager.) Otherwise, the preference order is assumed to only apply within a specific type and usage.
