[datatype-definition]
This data type transmits codes and the formatted text associated with the code. This data type can be used to transmit for the first time the formatted text for the *canned text* portion of a report, for example, a standard radiological description for a normal chest Xâ€‘ray. The receiving system can store this information and in subsequent messages only the identifier need be sent. Another potential use of this data type is transmitting master file records that contain formatted text. 

The components, primary and alternate, are defined as in the CE data type with the exception of the second, fifth, and eleventh components, which are of the formatted text data type.

The Original Text component applies to the CF as a whole.
