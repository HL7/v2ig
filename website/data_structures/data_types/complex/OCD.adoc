[NOTE]
Replaces the CM data type used in sections 6.5.10.10 UB1-16 and 6.5.11.7 UB2-7, as of v 2.5.

This data type carries data defined by CMS or other regulatory agencies. It corresponds to UB82 Fields 28â€‘32 and UB92 fields 32a, 32b, 33a, 33b, 34a, 34b, 35a, and 35b. Refer to a UB specification for additional information.

Use Case: A Medicare beneficiary was confined in hospital from January 1, 1992 to January 10, 1992, however, his Medicare Part A benefits were exhausted as of January 8, 1992, and he was not entitled to Part B benefits. Therefore, Form Locator 32 should contain code 23 and the date 010892.
