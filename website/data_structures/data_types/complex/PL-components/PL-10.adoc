== PL.10 - Comprehensive Location Identifier (EI)

[datatype-definition]
The unique identifier that represents the physical location as a whole without regard for the individual components. This accommodates sites that may have a different method of defining physical units or who may code at a less granular level. For example, point of care, room, and bed may be 1 indivisible code.
