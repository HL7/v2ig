[datatype-definition]
Specifies a person using both an identifier and the personâ€™s name. Retained for backward compatibility only as of v2.6.

[NOTE]
Restores the original data type CN as was initially implementable in the CM used in sections 4.5.3.32 and 7.4.1.32 - (OBR-32), 4.5.3.33 and 7.4.1.33 - ( OBR-33), 4.5.3.34 and 7.4.1.34 - ( OBR-34), 4.5.3.35 and 7.4.1.35 - (OBR-35). Components 7 and 8, however, have been promoted to data type IS to be consistent with current practice without violating backward compatibility.
