[datatype-definition]
The components that can be used to define the structure of the observation/result segments (OBX) within an observation report segment (OBR).

[example]
Original Mode - |1.3 2| where the dot and space are locally defined; Enhanced Mode - |^1^3^2| where the standard defines the purpose of the components to enable grouping.

[NOTE]
In original mode, OG.1 plus OBX-3 provides uniqueness; in enhanced mode OG.2 and OG.3 plus OBX-3 will provide uniqueness; OG.4 may not be present.
