==== Length & Persistent Data Stores
[v291_section="2.4.5.1"]

For many fields or components, the value domain of the content does not lead to clearly established boundaries for minimum and/or maximum length of the content.

[example]
s of value domains that do not have clearly established boundaries for minimum and maximum length:

• Parts of Names and Addresses

• Codes defined in external code systems

• Descriptive text

In many cases, systems store the information of these value domains using data storage mechanisms that have fixed lengths, such as relational databases, and must impose a limitation on the amount of information that can be stored. Though this does not directly impact on the length of the item in the instance, nevertheless the storage length has great significance for establishing interoperability.
