=== Intersystem Database Record Locking and Transaction Processing
[v291_section="1.8.18"]

HL7 Version 2.x standards make no attempt to provide messages that could support the coordination of database activities across multiple information systems in a heterogeneous computing environment. Users who want to operate their multiple systems as a distributed database environment must provide their own message support or rely on a database vendorâ€™s facilities (e.g., Oracle, Sybase, etc.).
