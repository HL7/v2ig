=== Disclosure of Disidentified Health Information
[v291_section="1.8.12"]

HL7 Version 2.x standards do not have specific messages to disclose “disidentified” health information. Disidentified data is data that does not reveal the identity of the person or care provider(s) (either organizations or individual licensed practitioners or both). While it may be possible to support this need with existing HL7 messages, it would create an unexpected message with missing required patient identification.
