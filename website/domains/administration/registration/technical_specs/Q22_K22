This query/response is designed for interaction between a client system and an MPI (Master Person Index). The query consists of a set of demographics for a person, and the response is the list of candidates considered by the MPI to match that set.

.Each returned person, specified by a PID segment, can also have an optional _QRI - Query Response_ Instance segment containing information about the quality of the match.

|Input Parameter |Comp. Name |DT |Description
|DemographicsFields | |QIP |Components: <segment field name (ST)> ^ <value1 (ST) & value2 (ST) & value3 (ST...>
| | | |Components may be any fields in the PID or PD1. If subcomponents of fields need to be specified, each subcomponent should be listed separately.
| | | |Example: ...\|@PID.5.1^EVERYMAN~@PID.5.2^ADAM~@PID.8^M\|...
|SearchConfidenceThreshold | |NM |Indicates the minimum match confidence for candidates to be returned for the query. The value instructs the queried system to return no records (PID segments) for persons whose "match weight" on the lookup was lower than the user-defined value.
| | | |Example: \|80\|
|AlgorithmName | |ST |Identifies the specific algorithm the queried system should use.
| | | |Example: \|MATCHWARE\|
|AlgorithmVersion | |ST |Identifies the specific algorithm version the queried system should use.
| | | |Example: \|1.2\|
|AlgorithmDescription | |ST |Description of the algorithm the queried system should use.
|WhatDomainsReturned | |CX |Components: <ID (ST)> ^ <check digit (ST)> ^ <code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ < assigning authority (HD)> ^ <identifier type code (IS)> ^ < assigning facility (HD)
| | | |This parameter restricts the set of domains for which identifiers are returned in PID-3. If this is not specified, then identifiers for all known domains shall be returned. It does not restrict the search for persons.
| | | |Example: ...\|^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL~^^^SOUTH LAB\|...
| | | |Only the following components should be valued.

Following is an example of a Q22/K22 query/response pair of messages. First is the query:

[er7]
RCP|I|20^RD

This query is asking for a list of persons matching the name ADAM EVERYMAN with the gender Male. Candidates with a match level above 80 using the algorithm Matchware version 1.2 should be returned. The returned records should include identifiers for both the assigning authorities GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL and SOUTH LAB. The RCP segment specifies that the number of matches should be limited to 20. Here is a sample response:

mailto:[mailto:]Three candidates were returned. Notice the 3 at the end of the QAK segment signifying the number of matches. Each has a PID and QRI segment, and the QRI segment in each case gives a confidence factor for each of the candidates
