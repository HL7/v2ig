.This query/response is designed for interaction between a client system and an MPI (Master Person Index). The query consists of an identifier for a person, and the response is a list of identifiers for that person from the domains specified.

|Input Parameter |Comp. Name |DT |Description
|PersonIdentifier | |CX |Components: <ID (ST)> ^ <check digit (ST)> ^ <code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ < assigning authority (HD)> ^ <identifier type code (IS)> ^ < assigning facility (HD)
| | | |The combination of values for _PersonIdentifier.ID, and PersonIdentifier.AssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a person uniquely. The _PersonIdentifier.IDTypeCode_ is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system.
| | | |Example: ...\|112234^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL\|...
| | | |Only one PID.3 may be specified, only 1 segment pattern will be returned.
| | | |
|PersonIdentifier |ID | |PID.3.1must be valued.
|PersonIdentifier |Assigning Authority | |PID.3.4 must be valued.
|PersonIdentifier |Identifier type code | |
|WhatDomainsReturned | |CX |Components: <ID (ST)> ^ <check digit (ST)> ^ <code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ < assigning authority (HD)> ^ <identifier type code (IS)> ^ < assigning facility (HD)
| | | |This parameter restricts the set of domains for which identifiers are returned in PID-3. If this is not specified, then identifiers for all known domains shall be returned. It does not restrict the search for the person.
| | | |Example: \|^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL~^^^SOUTH LAB\|
| | | |Only the following components should be valued.
|WhatDomainsReturned |Assigning Authority | |PID.3.4 must be valued.

Following is an example of a Q23/K23 query/response pair of messages. First is the query:

[er7]
MSH|^~\&|CLINREG|WESTCLIN|HOSPMPI|HOSP|199912121135-0600||QBP^Q23^QBP_Q21|1|D|2.5+
QPD|Q23^Get Corresponding IDs^HL7nnnn|111069|112234^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL|^^^WEST CLINIC~^^^SOUTH LAB|+
RCP||I|

This query is asking for identifiers from WEST CLINIC and SOUTH LAB for the person identified with the identifier 112234 from the assigning authority GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL. Here is a sample response:

[er7]
MSH|^~\&|HOSPMPI|HOSP|CLINREG|WESTCLIN|199912121135-0600||RSP^K23^RSP_K23|1|D|2.5|+
MSA|AA|8699|+
QAK|111069|OK|Q23^Get Corresponding IDs^HL7nnnn|1|+
QPD|Q23^Get Corresponding IDs^HL7nnn|111069|112234^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL|^^^WEST CLINIC~^^^SOUTH LAB|+
PID|||56321A^^^WEST CLINIC~66532^^^SOUTH LAB||EVERYMAN^ADAM||19630423|M||C|N2378 South Street^^Madison^WI^53711|

[NOTE]
that the identifiers returned do not include the GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL identifier, as it was not specified in the list of WhatDomainsReturned.
