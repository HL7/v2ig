= Application Management

== Introduction
[v291_section="14.2"]

This topic does not specify a protocol for managing networks, รก la TCP/IP SNMP. Rather, its messages provide a means to manage HL7-supporting applications over a network.

Because this topic was originally named "Network Management," the messages and segments have labels beginning with the letter "N." These labels are retained for backward compatibility.

As a technical topic, this information is normative with respect to the HL7 standard.
