This message is used to send information concerning the location and status of specimens from one application to another (e.g., automated equipment to a Laboratory Automation System). The OBX segments attached to the SAC should be used for transfer of information not included in the SAC segment, but relevant for automating processing (e.g., additional characteristics of the specimen container). The NTE segments attached to the SAC should be used for transfer of descriptive information not included in the SAC segment, but relevant for the users (e.g., aliquot groups for an aliquot sample container).
