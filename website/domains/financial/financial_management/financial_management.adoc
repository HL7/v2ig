= Financial Management

== Introduction
[v291_section="6.2"]

The Financial Mangement topic describes patient accounting transactions. Financial transactions can be sent between applications either in batches or online. As defined in Chapter 2 on batch segments, multiple transactions may be grouped and sent through all file transfer media or programs when using the HL7 Encoding Rules.

== General Use Cases / Background

=== PATIENT ACCOUNTING MESSAGE SET
[v291_section="6.3"]

The patient accounting message set provides for the entry and manipulation of information on billing accounts, charges, payments, adjustments, insurance, and other related patient billing and accounts receivable information.

This standard includes all of the data defined in the National Uniform Billing Field Specifications. We have excluded state-specific coding and suggest that, where required, it be implemented through site-specific negotiation. In addition, no attempt has been made to define data that have traditionally been required for the financial responsibility ("proration") of charges. This requirement is unique to a billing system and not a part of an interface.

We recognize that a wide variety of billing and accounts receivable systems exist today. Therefore, in an effort to accommodate the needs of the most comprehensive systems, we have defined an extensive set of transaction segments.

== Technical Specs
[v291_section="6.4"]

The triggering events that follow are served by Detail Financial Transaction (DFT), Add/Change Billing Account (BAR), and General Acknowledgment (ACK) messages.

Each trigger event is documented, along with the applicable form of the message exchange. The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repetition of segments is described in Chapter 2, "Format for Defining Abstract Messages."
