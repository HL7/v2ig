Event C02 - Cancel a patient registration on clinical trial (for clerical mistakes only since an intended registration should not be canceled)

The data are entered in a clinical trials or other patient data system and broadcast to other facility systems such as order entry, pharmacy, accounting, and nursing systems. They can be transmitted in batch mode or broadcast to outside-facility computer systems, including diagnostic and patient management systems. It is assumed that proper routing and security mechanisms are in place.
