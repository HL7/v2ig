.QPD Input Parameter Field Description and Commentary

|===
|Input Parameter (Query ID=Q31) |Comp. Name |DT |Description
|MessageQueryName | |CWE |Must be valued Q31^Dispense History^HL7nnnn.
|QueryTag | |ST |Unique to each query message instance.
|PatientList | |CX |The combination of values for _PatientList.ID, and PatientList.AssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a unique entry on the PATIENT_MASTER table. The _PatientList.IdentifierTypeCode_ is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system. (The PATIENT_MASTER table contains a constraint that prevents multiple patients from being identified by the same combination of field values.) This PATIENT_MASTER entry will be searched against on the PHARMACY_DISPENSE_TRANSACTION table to retrieve the rows fulfilling the query conditions. +

If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. +

If one PID.3 is specified, only 1 segment pattern will be returned.
| |ID |ID |If this field, PID.3.1, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match.

|MedicationDispensed | |CWE |If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match.
|DispenseDate.LL | |DTM |This is the earliest value to be returned for Date/Time Dispensed. If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match.
|DispenseDate.UL | |DTM |This is the latest value to be returned for Date/Time Dispensed. If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match.
