image:pharmacy_transaction_flow.jpg[pharmacy_transaction_flow]

=== OMP:

The Ordering application generates a pharmacy/treatment OMP and sends it to the pharmacy or treatment application, Nursing application, and/or other applications as appropriate at the site.

=== RDE:

The pharmacy/treatment application may send the RDE, the Pharmacy/Treatment Encoded Order message, a fully encoded order to the Nursing application, Ordering application, and/or other system applications as appropriate at the site.

== RDS:

The pharmacy/treatment application may send the RDS, the Pharmacy/Treatment Dispense message, to the Nursing application or other applications as appropriate at the site, each time a medication is dispensed for this order. This message may occur multiple times for each order.

=== RGV:

The pharmacy application may send the RGV, the Pharmacy/Treatment Give message, to the Nursing application or other applications as appropriate at the site, for each scheduled date/time of administration of a medication for a given order. This message may occur multiple times for each order.

=== RAS:

The Nursing application (and other applications) can generate the RAS, the pharmacy/treatment Administration Results message, whenever a medication is given to the patient. This message may occur multiple times for each order.

NOTE: Sites having a long term clinical data repository may wish to route data to the data repository from copies of all or any of the five messages.
