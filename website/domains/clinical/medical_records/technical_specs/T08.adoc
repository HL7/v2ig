The only valid use of this trigger event is for documents whose availability status is "Unavailable," i.e., the document has not been made available for patient care.

*Scenario*: Errors, which need to be corrected, are discovered in an existing "Unavailable" document. The original document is edited, and an edit notification and document content are sent.
