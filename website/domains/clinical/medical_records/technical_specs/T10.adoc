This is a notification of replacement to a document with the accompanying content.

[NOTE]
This trigger event is generally used when the original document availability status is "Available."

*Scenario:* Errors discovered in a document are corrected. The original document is replaced with the revised document. The replacement document has its own new unique document ID that is linked to the original document via the parent ID. The availability status of the original document is changed to "Obsolete" but the original document should be retained in the system for historical reference. Document replacement notification and document content are sent.
