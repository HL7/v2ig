=== Usage Notes for Donation Service (Blood Bank)
[v291_section="4.16.1"]

The Donation Service (BLOOD BANK) uses a different methodology than the similar Transfusion Service (BLOOD BANK) already present in this standard. Each of the segments defined for the Transfusion Service groups together all the 'transfusion' information in one segment, each. The Donation Service was developed breaking out the blood product 'donated' from the donation event itself. This is a more sustainable and interoperable approach. Future changes to the Transfusion Service should uptake this style.

=== Activity Diagram
[v291_section="4.16.2"]

The donation service messages facilitate communications between typical system components in a blood bank donation service facility. Frequently different components of blood banking systems (e.g. registration, questionnaire) are bundled together in one system produced by one vendor. However since there is no standard for that bundling, in any particular implementation any of the named system components can be implemented on another system and therefore communications to that component is necessary. The typical components are illustrated in the graphic below.

Additionally, the graphic also depicts a flow of information through those systems during a donation process.

=== Actors
[v291_section="4.16.3"]

As mentioned previously, many of the existing systems used in the collection process conduct all these actions in a single bundled system. Extension of the systems on this page is presented in this format because there is no standard for that bundling, in any particular implementation any of the named system components can be implemented on another system and therefore communications to that component is necessary.

==== Ordering Provider
[v291_section="4.16.3.0"]

For Directed and Autologous Donations, this is the Healthcare Provider requesting a blood donation.

==== Registration System
[v291_section="4.16.3.1"]

All donors are registered in this system.

==== Donor book of record System
[v291_section="4.16.3.2"]

This is the source-of-truth for every donor, whether evaluated and deferred, rejected, or not deferred.

==== Mini-physical System
[v291_section="4.16.3.3"]

The mini-physical examination conducted on all potential donors is documented using this system.

==== Questionnaire System
[v291_section="4.16.3.4"]

Each potential donor must fill out a questionnaire which asks about previous medical history and risk factors using this documentation system.

==== Donation System
[v291_section="4.16.3.5"]

The phlebotomists and other healthcare professionals use this system to document the blood donation procedure.

==== Device Interfaces
[v291_section="4.16.3.6"]

Interface to devices used during the mini-physical, donation, and shipping systems.

==== Provider Master
[v291_section="4.16.3.7"]

This system keeps the master list of providers.

==== Shipping System
[v291_section="4.16.3.8"]

This system is used to document the shipping manifest from information received from the actual donations.
