= Message - Multiple Laboratory Orders for Single Specimen
:v291_section: "4.4.8"
:v2_section_name: "OML â€“ Laboratory order for multiple orders related to a single specimen (event O33)"

The trigger event for this message is any change to a laboratory order. Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, etc., where multiple orders are associated with a single sample which may be carried in multiple containers. OML messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.

This allows for a Specimen-centric message with multiple orders per specimen grouped by the specimen.

The following message structure may be used for the communication of laboratory and other order messages and must be used for lab automation messages where the message requires Specimen/container information to group a number of orders.

The IPC segment in this trigger is used to transmit imaging process identifiers for observations that will result in DICOM information objects (e.g., slide images). Note that the IPC-1 Accession Identifier is the identifier assigned by the Order Filler for associating the DICOM results with other laboratory information and processes; it may or may not be the same as the SPM-30 Accession ID or the SAC-2 Accession Identifier.

In relationship to triggers O21, O33, and O35, this message/trigger (O33) should be used where a specimen, with optional multiple containers, may have multiple orders to be communicated.

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).
