[v291_section="4A.6.5"]

The Nursing application (and other applications) can generate the RAS, the pharmacy/treatment Administration Results message, whenever a medication is given to the patient. This message may occur multiple times for each order.

[NOTE]
Sites having a long term clinical data repository may wish to route data to the data repository from copies of all or any of the five messages.
