It is not clear that there is a good use case for the super segment pattern as described in the example in section _5.9.1.2.1_, "_Comprehensive pharmacy information Query Profile_."

As currently written the usage and naming of segment groups is not clear:

{empty}1. Can a segment group name refer to more than one structure?

{empty}2. Can the same structure have more than one segment group name?
