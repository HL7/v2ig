= Using Git Branches While Editing v2+
:toc:

.TODO
* what happens if two people edit the same file concurrently on GitHub and both try to commit with different changes?

== Branch Scope

Ideally, a separate branch should be created for each set of changes that are logically related.  Ideally, any changes that are related to any given Jira ticket will all be made in a single branch.
In this case, _only_ changes related to the Jira ticket should be made in the branch.  It may be the case, particularly during the early stages of v2+ development, that changes will be made
that are not specified by any Jira ticket.  In this case, it is still highly recommended that all changes in any given branch be limited to only those that are logically related to each other.

=== Restricted Branches

Note that making changes to the main branch is restricted.  This prevents inadvertent changes being made.  As we procede with the v2+ project, additional protected branches may be added.

=== Automated builds of branches

We are working towards an automated build process similar to that used by https://build.fhir.org/branches/[FHIR] and by the https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/branches/[UTG] project 
where individual branches will be built and deployed to the web so that the changes may be viewed in the context of the rendered v2+ specification.

It may be possible to manually build branches so that they can be viewed.  Ask the v2+ tooling developers about this if you have an immediate need to see how a feature branch will be rendered.

== Creating Or Selecting A Branch

In order to create a branch, visit the link:../[root v2ig page].

From this page, click the branch button as shown in the image below.

Next you can either create a new branch or select an existing branch

=== Creating a New Branch

To create a new branch, simply type a name for the branch into the input field as shown in the image below.

After typing the name of the branch in the input field, click below the field as shown in the image below.

You will be automatically switched to the newly created branch and you are ready to begin editing.

=== Switching to an Existing Branch

In order to make changes within an already existing branch, you will need to select that branch.  Simply click on the branch button and select your desired branch from the dropdown list.  Selecting a branch will automatically switch you to that branch and you will be ready to make edits.

=== View All Branches

You can view all of the branches by clicking on the Branch button and then selecting "View all branches" as shown in the image below.

This will take you to the https://github.com/HL7/v2ig/branches[branches page].  You can also create new branches from this page by clicking on the "New" button in the upper right.

== Merging A Branch Into The Main v2+ Branch - TODO

When a branch is ready to be merged into the main v2+ specification a `Pull Request` must be created.

== Diffing Between Branches

It is often helpful to view the differences between two branches.  This can, e.g., show you exactly what changed between to branches.  For more information about how to view diffs in GitHub, see the documentation https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits#comparing-branches[here].
