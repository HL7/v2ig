# HL7 v2+ Specification

This IG is in development and is not yet production ready.  It is not expected to successfully build using IG publisher.

Most, if not all, of the textual portions of the v2+ specification are captured as AsciiDoc.  This text is found in the `website` directory.  While the _exact_details are still being worked out, it is expected that building the v2+ IG will require a substantial preprocessing step that generates files appropriate for IG Publisher input.  This will include conversion of AsciiDoc into HTML and/or Markdown.  The converted text will be distributed to appropriate IG input files.
